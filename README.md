# KTRUTILS

What are KTRUTILS? This is a set of R utilities that I am originally creating for Applied Statistical Methods in Spring of 2024. But, hopefully this library can have a variety of useful statistical things that I can use in the future.

## Installation

You can install this package (although I am not sure why you would want to) via devtools directly, or pick your git install method of choice beyond this.

```r
devtools::install_github("fire833/KTRUTILS")
```
